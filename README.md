## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a passionate learner with a background in software development. After completing my Form Four studies, I joined Moringa School of Technology where I pursued the Foundation of Software Engineering and earned my certificate. I later advanced to the Full-Stack Software Engineering course at Moringa, from which I successfully graduated.
